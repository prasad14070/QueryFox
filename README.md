# QUERYFOX 🤖🦊
## AI-Powered Data Query Interface 🌐

## Problem Statement 📝

Organizations often struggle with efficiently accessing and understanding client data stored in internal databases. Traditional methods of data retrieval and analysis can be time-consuming and cumbersome, leading to delays in decision-making and inefficiencies in client management. There is a need for a streamlined and intuitive solution that allows organization members to query and receive timely, accurate insights from the database through a user-friendly interface.
