# AI-Powered Data Query Interface

## Problem Statement

Organizations often struggle with efficiently accessing and understanding client data stored in internal databases. Traditional methods of data retrieval and analysis can be time-consuming and cumbersome, leading to delays in decision-making and inefficiencies in client management. There is a need for a streamlined and intuitive solution that allows organization members to query and receive timely, accurate insights from the database through a user-friendly interface.

## Objective

Develop a chat interface that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to read and interpret client data from an internal database. This interface will enable organization members to query the database and receive accurate, contextually relevant responses about the data.

## Solution Overview

**QueryFox** is designed to solve the issues related to inefficient data access, cumbersome data retrieval, and client management inefficiencies.

### Key Features

- **Streamlined Data Access**: Provides an intuitive chat interface that simplifies accessing client data from internal databases.
- **Efficient Data Retrieval**: Leverages an LLM to interpret natural language queries and generate precise SQL queries, eliminating traditional complexity.
- **Enhanced Client Management**: Facilitates immediate and accurate data retrieval, improving client information management and satisfaction.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Allows interaction with the database through natural language commands, accessible to all organization members regardless of technical expertise.

## Workflow

1. **User Input**: User enters a natural language request.
2. **AI Processing**: The request is processed by the Generative AI model.
3. **SQL Query Generation**: AI generates the corresponding SQL query.
4. **Output Explanation**: The generated query is explained in detail.
5. **Formatting and Learning**: Users can format their SQL queries and learn from the detailed explanations provided.

## Tech Stack

- **Generative AI**: Google's Generative AI models for natural language processing and content generation.
- **Programming Languages**: Python for backend logic and AI integration.
- **Web Framework**: Streamlit for creating an interactive and user-friendly web interface.
- **Environment Management**: `dotenv` for managing environment variables securely.
- **API Integration**: Google Generative AI API for accessing AI capabilities.
